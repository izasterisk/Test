# Package Descriptions

| No | Package | Description |
|----|---------|-------------|
| 01 | Controller | This package contains classes that handle incoming HTTP requests and responses. They act as the entry point for the application, receiving requests from the client and delegating them to the service layer. Controllers manage API endpoints, request validation, response formatting, and HTTP status codes. |
| 02 | Service (BLL - Business Logic Layer) | This package holds the core business logic of the application. Services perform business-related operations and orchestrate calls to the repository and other components to fulfill a request. They implement business rules, data transformation, validation logic, and coordinate complex operations across multiple repositories. |
| 03 | Repository (DAL - Data Access Layer) | This package is responsible for data access. It contains classes that interact directly with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data models. Repositories abstract database operations and provide a clean interface for data manipulation. |
| 04 | Model (Data Models) | This package contains the data models or entities. These classes represent the structure of the data and often map directly to tables in the database. Models define properties, relationships, and database configurations through Entity Framework attributes and configurations. |
| 05 | DTO (Data Transfer Object) | These classes are used to transfer data between different layers of the application. They help to separate the internal data representation from the external API representation. DTOs ensure clean API contracts, reduce over-posting vulnerabilities, and provide flexibility in API design. |
| 06 | Mapper (AutoMapper Configuration) | This package contains classes that are responsible for mapping between DTO and Models. They help to keep the code clean by abstracting the conversion logic. AutoMapper configuration defines how properties from source objects are mapped to destination objects, reducing boilerplate code. |
| 07 | Config (Configuration) | This package contains classes for application-wide configuration. This includes Entity Framework configurations, database context setup, model configurations, security filters, and other application settings that define how the system behaves. |
| 08 | Utils (Utilities/Helpers) | This package contains helper classes and utility methods that are used across multiple parts of the application. They provide common functionalities to avoid code duplication, such as string manipulation, date formatting, file operations, calculation helpers, and reusable business logic components. |
| 09 | Validator (Data Validation) | This package includes classes for validating incoming data. They ensure that data meets specific business rules and constraints before being processed. Validators check data integrity, format, range, and business rule compliance to prevent invalid data from entering the system. |
| 10 | Constraint (Validation Rules) | This package contains classes or annotations that define specific validation rules, which are typically used by the validator classes. These include data annotations, custom validation attributes, and constraint definitions that enforce data quality standards. |
| 11 | Filter (Request Filters) | This package contains classes that process incoming requests before they reach the controller endpoints. Filters can handle authentication, authorization, logging, exception handling, request validation, and response modification. They provide cross-cutting concerns for the application. |
| 12 | Middleware | This package contains middleware components that intercept HTTP requests and responses in the pipeline. Middleware can handle CORS, authentication, error handling, logging, request/response transformation, and other cross-cutting concerns that need to be applied globally. |
| 13 | Interface (Service & Repository Interfaces) | This package defines contracts (interfaces) for services and repositories. Interfaces promote loose coupling, enable dependency injection, facilitate unit testing with mocking, and provide clear contracts for implementation classes. |
| 14 | Extension (Extension Methods) | This package contains extension methods that add functionality to existing types without modifying them. Extensions provide convenient helper methods, improve code readability, and enable method chaining patterns for common operations. |
| 15 | Infrastructure (External Services Integration) | This package contains classes that integrate with external services and APIs such as Cloudinary (image storage), email services, payment gateways (PayOS), address APIs (Goship), courier services, weather APIs, soil data APIs, and SignalR hubs for real-time communication. |
| 16 | Enum (Enumerations) | This package defines enumeration types used throughout the application. Enums provide type-safe constants for states, statuses, types, and categories, improving code clarity and preventing invalid values. Examples include OrderStatus, UserRole, PaymentMethod, etc. |
| 17 | Exception (Custom Exceptions) | This package contains custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios. Custom exceptions provide meaningful error messages, enable specific error handling logic, and improve debugging by categorizing different types of errors. |
| 18 | Constant (Application Constants) | This package defines constant values used across the application such as error messages, configuration keys, default values, API endpoints, and other unchanging values that are referenced throughout the codebase. |
| 19 | SignalR Hub | This package contains SignalR hub classes for real-time communication. Hubs enable server-to-client push notifications, real-time updates for notifications, chat messages, and other event-driven features that require immediate client updates. |
| 20 | Authentication & Authorization | This package implements JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization. It handles user login, token generation and validation, refresh tokens, password hashing, email verification, and access control to protect sensitive endpoints. |
